6482,France,"Full of the fresh acidity of the 2014 vintage, this light, bright wine has refreshing lemon and crisp apple flavors that are given richness by the lively acidity. Bursting with fruit, it is ready to drink now.",Terroir de Clessé,87,25.0,Burgundy,Viré-Clessé,Roger Voss,Domaine des Gandines 2014 Terroir de Clessé  (Viré-Clessé),Chardonnay,Domaine des Gandines
6483,Italy,"Aromas of peach blossom, red berry and sunbaked earth waft out of the glass. The luminous fruity palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and a hint of Mediterranean herb while a white almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter close.",Tenuta Paraida,88,15.0,Southern Italy,Copertino,Kerin O’Keefe,Marulli 2016 Tenuta Paraida Rosato (Copertino),Rosato,Marulli
6484,US,"Baked blackberries, purple flowers and a touch of leather show on the nose of this hearty bottling. The palate is framed by extremely strong, hard-to-cut tannins, which hold burned flavors of black coffee and charred berries.",Que Sirah Syrah Destiny Vineyards,85,50.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,Hunt Cellars 2010 Que Sirah Syrah Destiny Vineyards Red (Paso Robles),Rhône-style Red Blend,Hunt Cellars
6485,Argentina,"This is your quintessential New World Best Buy. The bouquet is full, slightly oaky and a touch burnt, and overall it's very nice. Same goes for the mouth, full of ripe berry and cassis flavors. It's medium to full in terms of weight and intensity, while the tannins create a chewy, masculine sensation.",Henry Lagarde Reserve,89,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,Lagarde 2005 Henry Lagarde Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
6486,France,"This full-bodied wine just lacks that bit of freshness that would've taken it to the next level. Stewed plums, black olives and espresso notes are rich and complex, ending on a long silky note. Drink now and over the next few years.",Vin Rare,89,41.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Joe Czerwinski,Dauvergne & Ranvier 2010 Vin Rare  (Gigondas),Rhône-style Red Blend,Dauvergne & Ranvier
6487,US,"This soft, high alcohol blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah is marked by extremely ripe flavors of blackberry jam and milk chocolate. It's technically dry but finishes with a touch of brown sugar. Drink now for voluptuous richness.",Harmonie,88,85.0,California,Paso Robles,,Clos Solène 2010 Harmonie G-S-M (Paso Robles),G-S-M,Clos Solène
6488,France,"An equal blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a crisper than other Champagnes in the Coutelas range. It is also still young with its bright green and citrus fruits and tense texture. Lively and fresh, it should be aged and not drunk before 2017.",Vintage Brut,91,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,A. D. Coutelas 2006 Vintage Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,A. D. Coutelas
6489,US,"This wine leaps out of the glass with fresh and bright aromas of strawberry blossoms, ripe raspberries, red flowers and a tiny bit of iron. The flavors are reminiscent of a potpourri satchel, with dried hibiscus flowers, tart cranberries, sour cherries and touches of pencil lead.",,88,20.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Matt Kettmann,Windrun 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Pinot Noir,Windrun
6490,Italy,"Zeta Dry, with a Zorro-style “Z” etched across the label, offers an easy-drinking sparkling wine experience with light shades of citrus, mineral and stone fruit.",Millesimato Dry Zeta,85,23.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,,Zardetto 2012 Millesimato Dry Zeta  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),Glera,Zardetto
6491,US,"With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure.",Ice,87,22.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,Wagner 2006 Ice Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),Vidal Blanc,Wagner
6492,Italy,"From one of southern Italy's leading producers, this hearty Aglianico offers earthy aromas of just-turned soil and blackberry. The delicious palate has a ripe core of black cherry accented with white pepper and balsamic notes. It's polished, round and very enjoyable now so drink soon.",,89,25.0,Southern Italy,Campania,Kerin O’Keefe,Mastroberardino 2011 Aglianico (Campania),Aglianico,Mastroberardino
6493,Italy,Cardomam seed and Indian spice give this wine a sassy and exotic personality. There's also plenty of plush fruit here as well followed by dry notes of crushed mineral at the back.,,86,10.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,Natale Verga 2010  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Montepulciano,Natale Verga
6494,Chile,"Strikingly pungent on first take, with crackling aromas of cactus, nettle, lime and grapefruit. Feels zesty, deep and layered, with an even mix of tropical fruit flavors, stone fruits and green notes. About as right as it gets for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.",EQ Coastal,91,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,Michael Schachner,Matetic 2011 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Matetic
6495,France,"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives,96,60.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,Domaine Schoffit
6496,US,"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel. The somewhat candied quality to the berry fruit was not favored by all tasters, but the plush yet structured mouthfeel has significant appeal. Dark sweet-tart fruit and moderate, even tannins work together to provide a positive finish.",Rustridge Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,,Rosenblum 1998 Rustridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Zinfandel,Rosenblum
6497,US,"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley. Tight cement and lime-rind flavors pop on the palate, where a sharp kumquat quality dissects the Bosc-pear warmth and the nuanced influence of damp dill and other green herbs.",Bien Nacido Vineyard,93,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Matt Kettmann,Stephen Ross 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,Stephen Ross
6498,Argentina,"Bold, jumpy, reduced aromas of plum and berry fruits show little to no oak. This is chewy and jammy in feel, with standard berry flavors and almost no complexity as it heads toward a finish with mild animal and herbal notes.",Serie A Santa Rosa,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,Zuccardi 2012 Serie A Santa Rosa Bonarda (Mendoza),Bonarda,Zuccardi
